# QuickRegist
A way for Berea College freshmen not to pull their hair out!
This program was built to help Berea College students register for classes as quickly and easily as possible.

A few disclaimers:
* This program is meant ONLY to work with Berea College's registration system through the Banner interface.
* The most current iteration of this program only works when the registration window is being run through Microsoft Edge in fullscreen; I do hope to develop a method of compatibility for other browsers but no promises.
* As of now there is nothing in the program double checking that an entered CRN is valid, other than checking that each CRN entered is 5 characters long. Use of an invalid CRN in the program WILL break it. I intend to develop an easy way to create a dictionary of what CRNs go to what courses each semester but again, no promises.
* I do not hold any responsibility you find a new and improved way of breaking this thing. Please use at your own risk.
